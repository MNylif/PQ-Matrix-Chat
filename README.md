# üõ°Ô∏è PQ Matrix Installer: Post-Quantum Secure Communication

## ‚ö° One-Command Installation

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MNylif/PQ-Matrix-Installer/main/install.sh | bash
```

## üåç Project Summary

In a world where quantum computing and advanced AI threaten traditional encryption methods, communities and organizations need truly secure communication channels. The PQ Matrix Installer provides a fully automated, quantum-resistant deployment system for Matrix servers, ensuring private communications remain private - even against state-sponsored attackers with quantum capabilities.

This project exists to democratize access to post-quantum security, allowing communities to communicate without fear of metadata collection, quantum decryption, or AI-powered surveillance. By combining hardware security modules, distributed trust protocols, and NIST-standardized post-quantum cryptography, we've created a system that's resistant to both current and future threats.

## üîí Security Architecture

### Military-Grade Quantum-Resistant Security

- **Post-Quantum Cryptography**: NIST-standardized Kyber-1024 for key encapsulation
- **Hardware Security Module Integration**: FIPS 140-3 Level 3 compliant YubiHSM
- **Distributed Trust Protocol**: 3-of-5 threshold cryptography across geographic regions
- **Zero-Knowledge Audit System**: Memory-mapped Shake-256 hashing with no persistent logs
- **Automated CIS Level 2 Hardening**: Comprehensive server security benchmarks
- **Cloudflare Zero Trust Integration**: Advanced proxy and DDoS protection

## üöÄ Deployment Process

The automated deployment process includes:

1. **Pre-flight System Checks**: Validates all required dependencies
2. **Secure Credential Management**: Encrypts all API keys and credentials
3. **Rclone Configuration**: Sets up encrypted cloud storage
4. **Borg Backup Integration**: Configures quantum-resistant backups
5. **Cloudflare Domain Automation**: Automates DNS and proxy configuration
6. **Server Hardening**: Applies CIS Level 2 security benchmarks
7. **HSM Key Management**: Stores encryption keys in hardware
8. **Distributed Trust Setup**: Splits master keys across geographic regions

## üîß Advanced Configuration

### Hardware Security Module Setup

```bash
# Initialize YubiHSM with quantum-resistant algorithms
python deploy.py --init-hsm

# Verify HSM configuration
yubihsm-shell --command="info session"
```

### Distributed Trust Configuration

```bash
# Generate threshold shards (3-of-5)
python deploy.py --generate-shards

# Deploy shards to secure locations
python deploy.py --deploy-shards
```

### Resource Optimization

The system automatically scans available resources and optimizes cryptographic parameters based on your hardware capabilities:

```bash
# View resource optimization details
python deploy.py --optimize-resources
```

#### Optimization Levels

| Resource Level | CPU Cores | Memory | Kyber Variant | Shard Count | Parallel Processing |
|----------------|-----------|--------|---------------|-------------|---------------------|
| Low            | < 4       | < 4GB  | Kyber512      | 3           | Disabled            |
| Standard       | 4-8       | 4-16GB | Kyber768      | 5           | Limited             |
| High           | > 8       | > 16GB | Kyber1024     | 5           | Full                |

The system automatically adjusts:
- **Thread Pool Size**: Optimized for your CPU core count
- **Memory Buffer Allocation**: Scaled based on available RAM
- **Compression Level**: Adjusted based on available disk space
- **Cryptographic Parameters**: Security level balanced with performance

## üìä Security Verification

```bash
# Run comprehensive security audit
python deploy.py --audit-security

# Test quantum resistance
python deploy.py --test-quantum-resistance
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **HSM Connection Failure**
   - Ensure YubiHSM is properly connected
   - Verify USB permissions with `lsusb`

2. **Shard Deployment Failure**
   - Check SSH keys for remote servers
   - Verify network connectivity to shard locations

3. **Quantum Library Issues**
   - Install liboqs dependencies: `apt install liboqs-dev`
   - Update to latest version: `pip install -U liboqs`
